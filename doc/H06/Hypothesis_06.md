#### Hypothesis 06:
### Which types of accidents are more frequent in various road surface conditions?

--
In this summary, the collision types are reclassified into major categories to simplify the visualization. Some of the road surface conditions are also removed (such as the gravel/sand, oil, muddy and flooded) as the proportion of these surface conditions are very small. This summary focuses mainly on dry, wet and the rest of wintry surface conditions such as snow, slushy/wet snow, and icy conditions.

Below is the graph and the tabulated summary of the collision per road surface. Surprisingly, the *Dry/Normal* road surface condition prominently has the highest number of collision compared to wintry and wet conditions. The *two vehicular accidents*  (both same and different direction) are the most type of collisions occur in dry/normal conditions. 

In terms of these "two vehicular accidents*, the vehicle running on the same direction type is consistently higher than the *different direction* collisions on dry/normal road surface condition but during the *wet* and *snowy* conditions, the *different direction* collisions are  higher.

The *single vehicular accident* appears frequently high on dry/normal road surface condition as well but it is the leading type of accident that occurs during the icy condition.
