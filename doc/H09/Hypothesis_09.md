#### Hypothesis 09:
### Which month of the year usually have high collision rate?
--
For total collisions, there are two periods in a year that has the highest rates of collissions. Summer months (**July and August**) and winter months (**December and January**). The trend is consistent over the years despite the drastic decline of total collisions from 1999 to 2011.

In terms of *Fatality*, the summer months of the year (**July and August**) appears the highest number of fatalities due to vehicular accidents.

The graphs and tables below show the trends for the **Total Collisions**  and **Fatalities**:
