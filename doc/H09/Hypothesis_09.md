### Which month of the year usually have high collision rate?
--
For total collisions, there are two periods in a year that has the highest rates of collissions. Summer months (**July and August**) and winter months (**December and January**). The trend is consistent over the years despite the drastic decline of total collisions from 1999 to 2011.

The second set of graph and table is a tabulation of dataset extracting only those collisions that produced fatality. The graph illustrates similarly that summer months of the year (**July and August**) appear the highest number of fatalities due to vehicular accidents.
