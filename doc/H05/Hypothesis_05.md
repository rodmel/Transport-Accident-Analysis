#### Hypothesis 05:
### In terms of single vehicular accidents, are young male drivers more dangerous compared to female drivers?
--

Below are the tabulated single vehicular accidents of young drivers 16 to 21 years old from 1999 to 2011. The frequency of young male driver accidents is consistently higher than female drivers but it has significantly reduced over the years. Although the trend has consistently declined, **the accident trends of both genders are very similar and have no significant difference.**
